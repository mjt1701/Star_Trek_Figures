# Star_Trek_Figures
Star Trek Hallmark Storyteller figures from the TOS episode Mirror, Mirror with added lights that illuminate the speaking figure.
The added lights are LEDs that use the lights on the figure's base to signal that the figure is talking and therefore should be illuminated. 
It uses a Arduino Nano to read the figure's light emittance using photoresistors and NeoPixal strip to illumitate the speficic figure. 

  Lights set of WS2812 RGBW LEDs based on lighting of Hallmark Star Trek Figure
  This sketch reads (photoresistor) the base light of each Star Trek figure
  to see if it speaking. If so, it lights the LEDs for that figure.
  Note: "talking" in comments means figure base light (colored base light),
  anytime this is on is "talking". including after sequence is done and lights
  are on but no voice.
