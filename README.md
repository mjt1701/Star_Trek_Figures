# Star_Trek_Figures
Star Trek Hallmark Storyteller figures from the TOS episode Mirror, Mirror with added lights that illuminate the speaking figure.
The added lights are LEDs that use the lights on the figure's base to signal that the figure is talking and therefore should be illuminated. 
It uses a Arduino Nano to read the figure's light emittance using photoresistors and NeoPixal strip to illumitate the speficic figure.
